	<body>
<P>
This file gives some quick introduction to <I>some</I> of the command options, even before you read
the full details in the <B>UserGuide.html</B>.
<P>
For Windows users, you can run the <B>QuickStart.bat or QuickStart</B> file which will execute many of these. 
Additional details are in the user guide and files available with the help options.
the most complete detail.
<P>
For non-windows downloads, you will get a file <B>QuickStart.txt</B>, which are the commands line by line,
which you can execute using copy-and-paste.
<P>
To take full advantage of the features, refer to the UserGuide.html, test and illustrative examples.
<P>
The tool name will be shown as mcpt.exe, non-windows users ignore the ".exe" extension.
<P>
For those not familar with command line entry, there are details in the UserGuide.html in the Options section.
<P>
Basically a command looks like: <I>mcpt -option=val or -option</I>.
In many cases, there are multiple options! Copy and run the entire line starting with <B>mcpt</B>.
<P>
Windows users, can just read the rest of this file for details, if you are running <B>QuickStart.bat</B>.
<P>
There are many more possibilities to keep your practice varied, and to work on different deficiencies. 
<P>
<H1>
Let's Go!
</H1>
<PRE>
Each command shown writes to your <B>SCREEN</B>, just so you can verify its the content you want, to get that to
your Morse Code tutor/training program, add the option: <I>-out=someOutputFile.txt</I>. This is placed in the current 
directory, unless you specify a path to another location (i.e. -out="c:\documents\myOut.txt").
<P>
Getting the file to your tutor is dependent on your situation (email files to a phone; drag-and-drop 
in windows; mv|cp in linux; LCWO.net users go to "Convert text to CW" screen, which has a Windows like browse feature).
<P>
Please run the command now, to get an overview of 4 other files, (they will be referred to in the next section)
<P>
mcpt -help=files
<P>
<B>
This section will show you just a few types of practice material that can be generated.  In these examples, all output 
goes to your screen. Examples will demonstrate minimal capability of features, and little explanation, the exmples in 
the user guide are more thorough and provide detail information.  For now, this is just to give you some flavor of features.
<P>
EVERYTHING about the material generated is configurable, don't get hung up about the words, lenghts, the quantity, etc.
<P>
Where you see "-in=word.txt", you can use any TEXT file (not MS Word, word processor), email, book, etc.
<P>
For any of the following, you can add -out=output.txt, and capture text in a file instead of to your screen.

<H3>
mcpt -codeGroups -cglen=5:5 -num=200 -len=30
</H3>
this overrides some of the defaults that were used above
<H3>
mcpt -codeGroups -cglen=3:6 -lesson=12
</H3>
repeat the first case, but limit code groups to lesson 12 of LCWO (its the default tutor)
<H3>
mcpt -codeGroups -cglen=3:6 -lesson=12 -tutor=lcwo
</H3>
repeat the first case, but limit code groups to lesson 12, specify the tutor to use (half dozen to choose)
<H2>
Commands for WORD related practice
</H2>
<H3>
mcpt -in=words.txt -inlen=3:10
</H3>
word length 3-10 characters from words.txt file (random order)
<H3>
mcpt -in=words.txt -mixedMode=3
</H3>
words with a code group eavey third entry
<H3>
mcpt -in=words.txt -mixedMode=3 -lesson=10 -tutor=g4fon
</H3>
repeat the above, adding -lesson=10, of the order taught in g4fon tutor
<H3>
mcpt -in=words.txt -mixedMode=3 -suflen=2

provide additional information.
<H3>
mcpt -in=words.txt -prosign=prosign.txt -num=40
</H3>
Each prosign appears, and is used as it it were a word. It therefore can interact with other word
options: suflen, prelen, repeat, etc.
<H3>
mcpt -in=words.txt -prosign=prosign.txt -num=40 -mixedMode=3 
</H3>
Each prosign appears, and is used as it it were a word AND in the interspersed code groups. Uppercase.
<H3>
mcpt -codeGroups -prosign=prosign.txt -num=40
</H3>
ProSigns used just like a SINGLE character.
<H3>
mcpt -callSigns
</H3>
Call signs generated for format practice. Can be limited to tutor/lesson.
<H2>
Some permutations of letters by tutor and lesson number
</H2>
mcpt -permute=p -lesson=15 -tutor=lcwo
mcpt -permute=b -lesson=15 -lesson=12 -tutor=g4fon
<H2>
A sending practice data generation (a special form of codeGroup)
</H2>

<H2>
Help Commands
</H2>
This section demonstrates online informational help, and commands to get it.
<P>
The help output is a quick help while using the tool, rather than refering to the User Guide. 
They are here just to give you an idea of the content.
<H3>
mcpt -help=LCWO
</H3>
ONLY for users of LCWO.net. Some ADVANCED training features which support on-the-fly changes of 
played code speed, Farnsworth timing, extended silence, etc. LCWO is highly recommended and free.
These features are shown in many examples toward the end of the user guide, but demonstrated here.
<H3>
mcpt -help 
</H3>
A listing of all options, their defaults, and values. Don't worry, you'll see shortly, that a given feature needs very few.
Also, all the options you need can be put into a file, instead of the command line.
(Run mcpt -help=files for information).
<P>
<H3>
mcpt -help=options
<H3/>
Use this option in addition to other command line options to see the full set of options mcpt is 
executing with. This will help you see the impact of default values that impact your output.
<H3>
mcpt -help=tutors
</H3>
Displays a table of Morse Code tutors (programs or training systems) such as LCWO.net and 
the characters taught by lesson number. Allows features to restrict practice to known characters.  
<H3>
