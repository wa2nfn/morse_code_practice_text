DESCRIPTION
       MCPT  generates text to be given to any Morse Code tutor which can cre-
       ate audible code from a	text  file.   Generated  text,	can  be:  code
       groups,	words  from  input file, or a hybrid. Options, provide altern-
       tives to the user to customize details of the practice text.

OPTIONS

       -codeGroups
	      set random code group generation vs. words from a file


       -callSigns
	      makes call signs using the current characters from  lesson/tutor
	      (default all)


       -cglen=min:max
	      set the length of a code group to be between a minimum and maxi-
	      mum value.  If the value is a single number,  the  minimum  will
	      equal the maximum.

       -cglist=LIST
	      set the list of a characters to use in a code group. Range nota-
	      tion (A-D), for upper, lower case letters  or  numbers  is  sup-
	      ported..IPf  an  "="  is in the LIST, the LIST must be in double
	      quotes. For international characters see: -help=international.


       -delimiter=DELIM
	      DELIM is a set of "^" separated  fields  to  use	an  inter-word
	      delimiter  string.  Fields  may  be,  literal (letters, numbers,
	      punctuation) or range notation (0-4A-Z), a  ProSign  (<SK>),  or
	      international character.

       -displayFormat=VALUE
	     VALUE is LF for linefeed, TAB change space to tabs, LF_TAB or 
	     TAB_LF to get both. These simply give more whitespacein output 
	     formatting for user readability (Output to be fed to a tutor for
	     playing audio don't have use for this option).

       -DM=min:max
	      Min  must  be  > 1, to get deminiters. The DelimiterMultiples is
	      the number or delimiter fields that will be concatenated to cre-
	      ate the inter-word delimiter.


       -DR    DelimiterRandom,	if "true" a delimiters appearance is random on
	      a word by word basis. The default is false..TP


       -header
	      STRING set a string to be output at  the  head  of  any	output
	      text. With LCWO this could set audio tone, interword spacing, or
	      just ouptut fixed text (i.e. vvv).


       -help  displays a usage for every option. With an parameter, as in  the
	      synopsis,  the help will display extensive text about subject of
	      the parameter (i.e.  -help=files).  -help=options  displays  the
	      current  state of all options after the impact of any values set
	      by the command line or an option file.


       -in    the input file name to parse for words matching criteria set  by
	      options:	inlist, inlen, lesson/tutor.  To keep a group of words
	      in original order, and treated  as  a  single  entity  by  other
	      options, replace the space between words with a tilde (~)..IP.e.
	      CQ~CQ~CD~DE. Hypheated words are	ignored,  as  are  words  with
	      apostrophe.


       -inlist
	      the  LIST  of characters that determine what qualifies as a word
	      from -in file.  Users might want to add a question mark  "?"  to
	      this  .IPST if -in contains c.w. abbreviationas and/or Q-signal-
	      sto get text like: qrs? or hw~cpy?  Note ProSigns do not need to
	      be  added to this option, thye will be treated as words if found
	      in -in file.


       -inlen=min:max
	      set the length of a word for the -in file to be between a  mini-
	      mum  and	maximum  value.   If the value is a single number, the
	      minimum will equal the maximum.


       -LCWO_slow=NUM
	      set the NUM of words to be sent an slow  speed  (-LCWO_low),  in
	      alternating slow/fast cycles.  (see -help=LCWO).


       -LCWO_fast=NUM
	      set  the	NUM  of  words	to  be sent an fast speed (-LCWO_low +
	      -LCWO_step), in alternating slow/fast cycles.  (see -help=LCWO).


       -LCWO_low=NUM
	      set the low  or  starting  speed	for  an  LCWO  feature.   (see
	      -help=LCWO).


       -LCWO_num=NUM
	      set  the	number of words or intervals in an LCWO feature.  (see
	      -help=LCWO).


       -LCWO_ramp
	      if set  true  (-LCWO_ramp|-LCWO_ramp=true)  indicates  the  LCWO
	      strady   ramp   up   of	speeds	intervals  is  desired.   (see
	      -help=LCWO).


       -LCWO_effective_ramp
	      if   set	  true	  (-LCWO_effective_effective_ramp|-LCWO_effec-
	      tive_ramp=true)  indicates  the LCWO strady ramp up of effective
	      speeds (aka Farnsworth) intervals is desired.  (see -help=LCWO).


       -LCWO_repeat=NUM
	      repeat each word at increased speed until NUM speeds  have  been
	      used.  (see -help=LCWO).


       -LCWO_random
	      if set true (-LCWO_random|-LCWO_random=true) sets EACH word to a
	      random speed determined by -LCWO_low, -LCWO_step,and  -LCWO_num.
	      (see -help=LCWO).


       -LCWO_step=NUM
	      the  step or speed increment to add to -LCWO_low to obtain a new
	      speed  setting,  may  be	reapplied  based  on  -LCWO_repeat  or
	      -LCWO_num.  (see -help=LCWO).


       LCWO_sf=STRING
	      a  string of characters to output when the speed is transitioing
	      from Slow to Fast (sf).  (see -help=LCWO).  The string can cause
	      other  LCWO behaviors (audio frequency tone changes, delays, see
	      User Guide)


       LCWO_fs=STRING
	      a string of characters to output when the speed is  transitioing
	      from Fast to Slow (fs).  (see -help=LCWO).  The string can cause
	      other LCWO behaviors (audio frequency tone changes, delays,  see
	      User Guide)


       -len   the character length of an output line. Length maybe exceeded to
	      prevent a word break.


       -lesson=NUM
	      a number greater than zero which indicates the "lesson" or char-
	      acter  index  as	taught by the specified code tutor. All lesson
	      and tutors are shown by  -help=tutors.  The  lesson/tutor  basi-
	      cally, replacecs both the -inlist and -cglist default values.


		     -mixedMode-NUM
	      combines	words from -in file, and code groups in the same prac-
	      tice text. NUM determines the appearance	rate  of  code	groups
	      (must be at least equal to 2).


       -MMR   MixedModeRandom  if  set	to  true  (-MMR|-MMR-true)  makes  the
	      appearance of the code group random.

       -must  A string of 1 or more characters. One will be used as a substitue
        	for character in a codeGroup/word/string.


       -num   the number or words or codeGroups the user wants.


       -NR    NonRandom if set to true	(-NR|-NR=true)	reatins  the  original
	      order  of  words	found  in  an -in file.  Words still must meet
	      other criteria (inlen, inlist).


		     -opt=file where the file is a list of options instead  of
		     or in addition to command line options.
	      (see  -help=files)..IPf  -opt=file is included on a command line
	      AND the file does not exist, mcpt interprets this  to  mean  the
	      user  wnts to create a file with the current command line values
	      to avoid retyping them.


       -out=outfile
	      create a file of text based on the evaluation  of  all  options.
	      Without this value STDOUT is used.  Most code tutors accept text
	      from a file, some have an input box which would allow  copy-and-
	      paste from STDOUT.


       -prelen=min:max
	      set  the length of a prefix or characters (-prelist=LIST) to put
	      before a word or code group.  If the value is a  single  number,
	      the minimum will equal the maximum.


       -prelist=STRING
	      a  list  of characters to be reandomly selected to create a pre-
	      fix.


       -prosign=FILE
	      a file of ProSigns, one per line, to use intermittantly in input
	      words and/or code groups.  (see -help=files)


       -random
	      makes  the  appearance  or  a prefix and/or a suffix random on a
	      word(or code group) basis.


       -repeat=NUM
	      for each word meeting th matching criteria, repeat it NUM  times
	      in sequence.


       -reverse
	      reverses	the spelling of all matched words in -in file. Retians
	      the letter frequency or matches but reduces the word recongition
	      factor.


       -skip=NUM
	      Skips  over  the	first NUM words in the -in file which meet the
	      selection criteria.  User might want to skip a  large  table  of
	      contents, or lists of illustrations, etc.


       -suflen=min:max
	      set  the	length	of  a suffix or characters (-suflist=.IPST) to
	      append to a word or code group.  If the value is a  single  num-
	      ber, the minimum will equal the maximum.


       -suflist=STRING
	      a  list  of characters to be reandomly selected to create a suf-
	      fix.


       -tutor=LIST
	      the name of supported code tutors (case insensitive, and in some
	      cases  an  abbreviated equalivalent) (see -help=tutors). If your
	      favorite tutor is not listed, simply specify  both  -inlist  and
	      -cglist in your option file).


       -unique
	      will  not duplicate any words in output..IPts possible this will
	      reduce the number requested by -num.
