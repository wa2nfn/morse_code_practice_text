#
#  This is a SAMPLE option file for MCPT. It has almost every option in it, with a brief comment
#  about it. Get more information from: mcpt.exe -help or UserGuide.html.
#
#  You should COPY this file, and experiment with the copy.
#
#  Normally an option file will only contain a small set of the options below, and be
#  given a name that provides a hint as to its use i.e. codeGroup.txt.
#  It is typical for a user to have several option files and therefore rarely need to
#  edit the file after it's tested, or use options on the command line.
#
#  There are important details about the option file not covered here, see the UserGuide.html.
#
#  A few options would never be in an option file: help, or opt.
#
#  This is a plain text file, do not use a Word Processor for editing unless it has a save as .txt option
#
#
# How To Get Started Choosing Options
# ===================================
# You can edit a copy of this file, changing and removing unwanted options until you have
# created an option file for the type of practice you want.
#
# Another alternative, is to type a minimal set of options on the command line (leaving out the <out>
# option temporarily. After seeing the result, add/or change options, until satisfiled. 
# The two steps are to add the <out=someFile> option to the command line, AND add <-opt=someOptFile.txt>.
# MCPT will see that you asked for an option file that does not exist (this could be a typing error under 
# other circumstances, but here its purposeful) entrer "y" to the question about creating a file. All the
# command line options that you just tested will be written to the file.
# The file is now ready to use eliminating the need to maunally enter options. You simply
# enter: mcpt.exe -opt=someOptionFile.txt.
