#
#  This is a SAMPLE option file for MCPT. It has almost every option in it, 
#  with a brief comment about it. Get more information from: mcpt.exe -help 
#  or UserGuide.html.
#
#  You should COPY this file, and experiment with the copy.
#
#  Normally an option file will contain a small set of the options below, 
#  and be given a name that provides a hint as to its use i.e. codeGroup.txt.
#  It is typical for a user to have several option files and therefore 
#  rarely need to edit the file after it's tested, or use options on the 
#  command line.
#
#  There are important details about the option file not covered here, see 
#  the UserGuide.html.
#
#  A few options would never be in an option file: help, or opt.
#
#  This is a plain text file, do not use a Word Processor for editing unless
#  it has a save as .txt option
#
#
# How To Get Started Choosing Options
# ===================================
# You can edit a copy of this file, changing and removing unwanted options 
# until you have created an option file for the type of practice you want.
#
# An alternative, is to type a minimal set of options on the command line
# (leaving out the <out> option temporarily. After seeing the result, 
# add/or change options, until satisfiled. 
# The two steps are to add the <out=someFile> option to the command line, 
# AND add <-opt=someOptFile.txt>.
# MCPT will see that you asked for an option file that does not exist 
# (this could be a typing error under other circumstances, but here its 
# purposeful) entrer "y" to the question about creating a file. All the
# command line options that you just tested will be written to the file.
# The file is now ready to use eliminating the need to maunally enter options.
# enter: mcpt.exe -optFile=someOptionFile.txt.
