# This can be used to obtain ProSign (procedure signals) in your Morse practice.
#
# 1-  Name the file anything to reduce typing on the command line or in the 
#     options file. However, changing the ".txt" extension may limit your 
#     ability to edit it.
#
# 2-  A "#" in front of the prosign comments it out, as if it were removed.
#
# 3-  This file is used for TWO of the FOUR ways you can get prosign practice.
#     Code groups practice: 
#         add to your command line:  -codeGroups -prosign=prosign.txt
#     Word practice: 
#         add to your command line:  -in=words.txt -prosign=prosign.txt
#         add to your command line:  -text=words.txt -prosign=prosign.txt
#
#     Also get prosign practice with the delimiter option, or having prosigns
#     in your input file, just like a word. Neither of these methods require 
#     this file or option.
#    
#     Please refer to the User Guide.
#
# 4-  Only the following prosigns are supported in this file. Any place the 
#     prosigns are used they can be in either upper or lowercase.
#
#     <AS>, <AR>, <BT>, <KA>, <HH>, <SN> or <VE>, <SK> or <VA>, <SOS>
#     Comment out any you have not learned or your tutor does not support.
#
#     An alternate format is: ^AS, ^sk, etc. The G4FON uses this format.
#
