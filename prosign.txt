# This can be used to obtain ProSign (procedure signals) in your Morse practice.
#
# 1-  You can rename the file anything you like to reduce typing on the command line or
#     in the options file if you like. However, changing the ".txt" extension may limit
#     your ability to edit it.
#
# 2-  Putting a "#" in front of the prosign comments it out, just as if it were removed.
#
# 3-  This file is used for TWO of the FOUR ways you can get prosign practice.
#     Code groups practice: 
#         add to your command line:  -codeGroups -prosign=prosign.txt
#     Word practice: 
#         add to your command line:  -in=words.txt -prosign=prosign.txt
#
#     You can also get prosign practice with the delimiter option, or having prosigns
#     in your input file, just like a word. Neither of these methods require this file or option.
#    
#     Please refer to the User Guide.
#
# 4-  Only the following prosigns are supported in this file. Any place the prosigns are used
#     they can be in either upper or lowercase.
#
#     <AA>, <AS>, <AR>, <BT>, <CT> or <KA>, <HH>, <KN>, <SK>, <SN>
#     Note: <CT> and <KA> make the same sound, and have the same meaning. Comment out the one
#     you have learned or your tutor does not support.
#
#     An alternate format is: ^AA, ^sk, etc. The G4FON uses this format.
#
#     Retaining an unaltered copy of this file for future reference is recommended.
